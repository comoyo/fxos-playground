webgl-text
==========

WebGL might be an interesting piece of technology for building 2D UIs (in addition to the "obvious" stuff like games). However, it has the same limitation as normal OpenGL, which is that it has no text rendering or text input.

This project is a small attempt to work around that problem. It attempts to utilize the 2D canvas to render text and attempts to bridge normal HTML input elements with WebGL.
